    <p>My name is David Castaneda and I'm a senior at Santa Ana High School.<p/>
    <p>I have never taken an engineering class before which is why I am taking this course.</p>
    <p>My interests are video games and sports especially soccer, basketball and baseball.</p>
    <p>My goal in this class is to be able to expand my knowledge on computers to help me in the future.</p>
